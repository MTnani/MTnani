# Hi there, I'm Moez 👋 


- 👋 Hi, I’m Moez Tnani @MTnani

- 👀 I’m interested in Software Testing

- 🌱 "Pretty good testing is easy to do (that’s partly why some people like to say ‘testing is dead’– they think testing isn’t needed as a special focus because they note that anyone can find at least some bugs some of the time). Excellent testing is quite hard to do.” — James Bach

- 🥅 I’m currently learning everything

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with other content creators

- 📫 How to reach me ...
